            <h1 class="cover-heading" >WHAT</h1>
            <p class="lead" >This website allows you to submit text to correctly convert standard he/she third-person pronouns into their gender-neutral versions. Use people's preferred pronouns when speaking of and/or addressing them. Not sure which pronouns to use? Ask the person nicely. When in doubt, using gender neutral prounouns is your safest bet, as it makes language generic and inclusive.</p>

            <br>
            <h1 class="cover-heading" >WHY</h1>
            <p class="lead" >Gender neutrality is important to avoid gender-based discrimination, include people who don't identify within the gender binary, and improve understanding of the variety of others' gender identities. Many people don't want to use pronouns that have a gendered bias. Traditional use of she/he pronouns, and exclusion of all others, support the idea of a restrictive gender binary that doesn't reflect the complexity of the human race. Individuals get to choose their preferred pronouns, and speaking in accordance with their choice of personal language is a matter of respect.</p>

            <br>
            <h1 class="cover-heading" >HOW</h1>
            <p class="lead" >The general public's understanding of pronoun usage and gender is limited to the resources that are availible. With the avalibility of custom gender options on social media, numerous websites about non-binary issues, and tools like this, people can learn that there are more options than the male and female checkboxes they've always seen. If you'd like to learn more, check out books, magazines, and websites that talk about subjects such as:
